## 💡 Features

- ✅ Handles multiple clients concurrently using a fixed thread pool
- ✅ Bi-directional communication: clients send messages, server responds
- ✅ Clean resource management with auto-closing streams
- ✅ Extendable to file transfer, basic HTTP serving, or chat applications

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8+)
- Sockets (`java.net.Socket`, `java.net.ServerSocket`)
- ExecutorService (`java.util.concurrent`)
